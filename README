README: ASD_microbiome_AAB_QTAB code
Author: Chloe Yap
Date: 8 October 2021

Description:
This repository contains code used in the AAB and QTAB stool metagenomics analysis.

Contents:
metagenomics_analysis_taxonomic_manuscript.Rmd
	- contains code for most analyses (eg. microbiome diversity, differential abundance, linear models)
	- N.B. the code contained here is specific to the taxonomic for demonstration purposes.
		However, where mentioned in the manuscript, identical analyses were performed for functional datasets.

diet/
	AES_PCs_ACRC_QTAB_manuscript.html
		- .html knitted .Rmd document
		- includes code and figures from exploratory analysis of dietary data

osca_variancecomponent/
	metagenomics_analysis_osca_prep_manuscript.Rmd
		- .Rmd file used to pre-process microbiome count data (taxonomic and functional).
		- output of this code is used as input into OSCA, using commands in metagenomics_analysis_osca_manuscript.sh
	metagenomics_analysis_osca_manuscript.sh
		- .sh file with OSCA commands to generate ORMs, and to perform variance component analysis

linktaxafunc/
	metagenomics_analysis_linktaxafunc_manuscript.R
		- R script to extract:
			 - count table for genes directly and specifically mapping to Romboutsia timonensis ("direct" analysis)
			 - count table for genes that are within the Romboutsia timonensis genome, but can be encoded by any other species ("indirect" analysis)
	metagenomics_analysis_linktaxafunc_ancom_direct_manuscript.R
		- R code used to perform the "direct" analysis
		- input the "direct" analysis output from metagenomics_analysis_linktaxafunc_manuscript.R (eg. "aab_Romboutsia.timonensis_MICROBAgenes.txt")
		- differential abundance analysis (ANCOMv2.1)
